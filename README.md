## My personal feeling about this project:

YES! Thank GOD! Officially, I completed my first ever project from the foundation course of TOP (The Odin Project). It’s such a great feeling doing something by yourself, even if it’s something small or simple. I hope it continues like this for the rest of the course (lol, I’m sure it won’t!). This project was simple. Something that I would say I can do in my sleep. But still, there were times when I got a little bit confused. Like, what to do? Is there any better way to do this thing? Overall, I felt happy doing this project and not sad and frustrated (it wasn’t hard).

## Project Description:

Let’s get serious. Shall we? Okay, this project is a simple multi-page HTML website designed to help users explore different food recipes. This website will allow users to look up the ingredients and steps on how to cook that dish on each of its own dedicated web pages (currently, it has only 3 recipes to explore). We have four web pages. The first one is the homepage, which contains a heading text(`<h1>`) and three links. These links can redirect you to web pages that contain the recipe for that individual dish. Each recipe page has a heading text, an image of the dish, a description of the recipe, ingredients, steps, and a link that will take you to the homepage.

## The problem I faced:

The problem that I faced was, can I use heading text (`<h1>-<h6>`) tags inside `<ul>` or `<ol>` tags? After doing some research and asking for help in the TOP Discord community, the answer I got was that it doesn’t make sense to have some other tags inside `<ol>` or `<ul>` tags except `<li>` tags. And it’s also confirmed by the W3C HTML Validator. 
There were some solutions for this problem:
1. You can have your heading text outside your `<ul>` or `<ol>` tags, but semantically, it doesn’t make sense. Because the screen reader won’t be able to understand and associate the heading text as the caption or title for `<ul>` or `<ol>` tags.
2. There was a CSS solution that made much more sense, but as this project only required you to use HTML. I didn’t use that solution for it (I don’t think I need to discuss it here).

## What I learned:

Well, there wasn’t much to learn, because it was fairly simple and easy to do. After experiencing the problem discussed above. Overall I learned:
  - How to ask better questions to get better answers
  - Mentioning and being explicit about every detail and avoiding the incorrect use of coding terminology while asking a question.
  - To do my research more carefully and focus a lot on it before asking any questions.
