    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Amish-style slaw is a crisp, tangy cabbage salad dressed in a sweet and zesty vinegar-and-oil based dressing made from white <br>vinegar, vegetable oil, sugar, celery seed, mustard, salt, and pepper, mixed with shredded cabbage and sliced onion; it takes about<br> 15 minutes to prepare and cook the dressing and around 20 minutes total, and while it can be enjoyed right away, letting it chill<br> a couple of hours enhances the flavor and texture into a refreshing side dish perfect for picnics, barbecues, or meals that need a <br>bright, crunchy accompaniment.
